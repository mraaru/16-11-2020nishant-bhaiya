                    cont='Equality, it is a term that has been a subject of discussion for
                    centuries now. Sometimes it is a talk of equality between races,
                    sometimes between countries and sometimes between genders. The
                    subject variable might change but the stress on equality remains
                    constant. Why is it that even through passage of several
                    centuries of political awakening we are yet to see a state of
                    total equality among ourselves. Could it not be worth a
                    discussion here that equality itself is variable. Although the
                    dialogues have been going on for a long time on these topics but
                    in the Indian context the general population is yet to grasp
                    this idea in a more comprehensive sense. This article might help
                    you all get an idea of it in a more simple way. There are two
                    tenets of equality that are often used while comparing it to a
                    sample. First, Equality of opportunity which suggests that a
                    person must have accessibility to any opportunity with regards
                    to their career, education, livelihood and health no matter what
                    their gender, race, caste or creed is. Secondly, Equality of
                    outcome which maintains a belief that if there isn’t an equal
                    representation of the different genders, races, castes or creeds
                    in the economic or political representation, then that signals
                    an issue with the whole system within. This is an appalling idea
                    and needs a detailed discussion. Let me explain without any
                    prejudice why it has to be an idea worth scrutinizing. Let us
                    assume there is an unequal representation of men and women in
                    any company or organisation, women being on the lower side of
                    representation. Now this phenomenon would not mean on itself
                    that there is a discrimination on the sole basis of gender.
                    Someone may argue that it is so, and they might be correct if
                    proved so. Now let us reverse the situation here and get the men
                    on the lower side of the spectrum. We need to take a few steps
                    back and really examine this situation carefully. Not everyone
                    is equal in their academic temperament and even more so unequal
                    in their overall personality. There have been quite a few
                    researches done over the past few decades on the subject of
                    representation of men and women in STEM fields in several
                    countries (citation of a few given below). The result that they
                    showcased was nonetheless astounding. Many social scientists and
                    scholars had earlier believed that since our population is more
                    or less a 50-50% distribution among the two major genders,
                    namely male and female: if an effort was put in to make sure
                    that all the direct and indirect hindrances and causes of
                    inequality were removed then inevitably an equal representation
                    of the same genders would follow everywhere. In other words, if
                    men and women were admitted to every sector of the society with
                    no discrimination based on gender or any other unjustified
                    criteria then they would eventually be represented equally
                    everywhere. This was an idea that was popularly believed.
                    However, It was seen that the more egalitarian the society
                    became the greater the differences among the genders became.
                    This meant, the more equal laws are passed and discriminations
                    are removed the genders tend to get divided more in their
                    temperament of career choices. This wasn’t just an opinion of
                    one person but an observation through several researches without
                    any ambiguity. The result was obviously shocking to everyone.
                    There were more men interested in fields of science, technology,
                    engineering and mathematics than women. Also more women were
                    interested in fields on medical science and hospitality than
                    men. Now, is this fundamentally a bad sign? It is often thought
                    by many people that in an event of disproportionate gender
                    presence in an organisation, there has to be some issue of
                    discrimination. According to me, they are looking at the picture
                    the wrong way. The idea to ensure an equal outcome is a bad one.
                    We should be focusing on equality of opportunity for all by
                    removing the impediments for everyone no matter their gender. It
                    shouldn’t be a bad thing if there are more female doctors than
                    male doctors and thus dare I ask, should it be presumed
                    negatively if there are more male engineers than female
                    engineers. Striving for equality of opportunity doesn’t mean it
                    will end up in equality of outcome and with the new evidence
                    from studies based on the subject it is clearer now. If there is
                    a desire to bring equality among the different identitarian
                    groups then the solution is not to make it compulsory for every
                    company, organization, institution, or office of administration
                    to reflect a mirror image of the population, rather it should be
                    ensuring that no one is given preference for their
                    differentiation from the others. Albert Einstein said - “Before
                    God, we are equally wise and equally foolish”, and I stress that
                    he said we all are equal to the eyes of god. We are wise if we
                    think our peers to be of the same sovereign character as we
                    regard ourselves and we will be foolish to think otherwise.
                    There are many factors that affect competence of different
                    people at any organisation. It is a multi-variable equation
                    among which gender is a factor, the other factors being
                    industriousness, educational qualification, agreeableness,
                    intelligence, conscientiousness, health etc to name a few. So
                    gender does play an unfair role but it is not the only factor.
                    We should not try to look at the picture through a keyhole while
                    the door can be opened. For example industriousness, educational
                    qualification, intelligence and conscientiousness predict
                    success positively, so the more industrious, competent,
                    intelligent you are the more successful you become but
                    agreeableness predicts it negatively.'
